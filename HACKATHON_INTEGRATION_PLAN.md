## 🏅 Sponsor Integrations

### 1. YELLOW NETWORK ($5,000 Prize Pool)

#### **Prize Targets:**
- 🥇 1st Place: $2,500
- 🥈 2nd Place: $1,500

#### **Integration Strategy:**
**Use Case:** Instant, Gasless Gaming Sessions

**How it works:**
1. Players deposit funds ONCE into Yellow state channel
2. Play multiple games with INSTANT, GAS-FREE transactions
3. Game actions (create, join, score updates) happen off-chain
4. Final settlement happens on-chain when session ends

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Solidity escrow contract with Yellow integration hooks
- ✅ Yellow SDK for session management
- ✅ Off-chain game state with on-chain finality
- ✅ Multi-game sessions without per-transaction gas

**Key Features:**
- Session-based wallet (deposit once, play multiple games)
- Instant game creation and joining (no blockchain wait)
- Real-time score updates with zero latency
- Batch settlement when user logs out

**Demo Flow:**
1. User connects wallet → Creates Yellow session
2. Deposits 0.1 ETH → Session opens
3. Plays 10 games → All instant, no gas
4. Logs out → Final settlement on-chain

- 🥇 Best Use: $3,500
- 🥈 Best Launch: $2,500
- 🥉 Multi-Agent: $1,750

#### **Integration Strategy:**

**A) AI Game Referee Agent:**

**Agent Name:** "OrbitReferee"

**Purpose:** Autonomous game monitoring and result verification

**Capabilities:**
1. **Real-time Game Monitoring**
   - Watches video streams of both players
   - Tracks game progress (pushups, gestures, paddle positions)
   - Validates game rules compliance

2. **Winner Determination**
   - Analyzes final scores
   - Verifies no cheating occurred
   - Submits winner to smart contract

3. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Reviews disputed game footage
   - Provides reasoning for decision
   - Suggests fair resolution

**Tech Stack:**
- **uAgents:** Core agent logic and autonomy
- **Agentverse:** Agent hosting and discovery
- **ASI:One:** Human-to-agent chat interface
- **MeTTa:** Knowledge graphs for rule reasoning

**B) Human-Agent Interaction:**

Users can chat with OrbitReferee:
- "Was this game fair?"
- "Why did I lose?"
- "Review my last game"
- "How can I improve?"

**C) Multi-Agent System:**

**Agent Ecosystem:**
1. **RefereeAgent** - Game monitoring
2. **EscrowAgent** - Payment handling
3. **MatchmakingAgent** - Player pairing
4. **StatsAgent** - Performance analytics

Agents communicate via Fetch.ai messaging to coordinate:
- Matchmaking → Escrow → Referee → Stats

**Demo Flow:**
1. Game starts → RefereeAgent activates
2. Monitors video feeds using AI
3. Game ends → Agent verifies scores
4. Agent submits result to blockchain
5. User asks "Why did I lose?" → Agent explains with MeTTa reasoning

## 🎯 Winning Strategy

### Yellow Network
**Stand Out:** Session-based gaming is PERFECT for their use case
- Show 10+ games played in one session
- Emphasize UX improvement (no gas prompts)
- Demo video showing instant gameplay

### Blockscout
**Stand Out:** Dual integration (Autoscout + SDK)
- Custom branded explorer
- In-app SDK with real-time updates
- Show transparency and user trust

### ASI Alliance
**Stand Out:** Real-world AI referee use case
- Live agent monitoring games
- Human interaction for disputes
- Multi-agent coordination
- MeTTa for rule reasoning
