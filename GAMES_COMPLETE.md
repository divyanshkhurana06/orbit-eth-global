# 🎮 Orbit - Complete Games List

## ✅ All 4 Games Are READY!

All games use **real AI** for fair gameplay and are fully multiplayer-enabled via Socket.io.

## 1. 🔍 Object Hunt (FULLY WORKING)

**How it Works:**
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD (real object detection)
- **Goal**: Race to find and show the target object to your camera
- **Winner**: Fastest player to present the correct object

**Features:**
- Real-time object detection with bounding boxes
- 25+ detectable items (phone, cup, fork, spoon, mouse, keyboard, book, etc.)
- Countdown timer
- Shows detection confidence percentages
- Automatic winner determination based on speed

**Technical:**
- Uses `@tensorflow/tfjs` and `@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd`
- Runs detection every 500ms
- Green bounding box = target found
- Red bounding box = other objects detected

## 2. ✋ Hand Raise (FULLY WORKING)

**How it Works:**
- **AI Model**: MediaPipe Hands (hand gesture tracking)
- **Goal**: Be the first to raise your hand when signal appears
- **Winner**: Fastest reaction time

**Features:**
- Real hand tracking with 21 landmarks per hand
- Detects when hand is raised (middle finger above wrist)
- Countdown before "GO!" signal
- Measures reaction time in milliseconds
- Visual hand skeleton overlay

**Technical:**
- Uses `@mediapipe/hands` with CDN delivery
- Detects vertical hand position
- Calculates reaction time from signal to hand raise
- Syncs times via Socket.io

## 3. ✊ Rock Paper Scissors (FULLY WORKING)

**How it Works:**
- **AI Model**: MediaPipe Hands (hand gesture recognition)
- **Goal**: Show rock/paper/scissors gesture with your hand
- **Winner**: Best of 1 round (standard RPS rules)

**Features:**
- Real-time gesture detection:
  - **✊ Rock**: Closed fist (0-1 fingers extended)
  - **✋ Paper**: Open hand (3+ fingers extended)
  - **✌️ Scissors**: Two fingers (index + middle)
- 3-second countdown
- Visual feedback for detected gesture
- Automatic winner calculation

**Technical:**
- Analyzes finger extension using landmark positions
- Counts extended fingers to determine gesture
- Locks choice once detected
- Waits for both players before revealing winner

## 4. ⚡ Reflex Challenge (FULLY WORKING)

**How it Works:**
- **No AI needed**: Pure reaction time test
- **Goal**: Click as soon as the screen turns green
- **Winner**: Fastest reaction time

**Features:**
- Red screen: "WAIT" (don't click!)
- Random delay (2-5 seconds)
- Green screen: "CLICK NOW!"
- Measures time in milliseconds
- Click too early = automatic loss

**Technical:**
- Uses `Date.now()` for precise timing
- Random delay prevents pattern memorization
- Syncs reaction times via Socket.io
- Shows comparison of both players' times

## 🎯 How to Play

### Starting a Match:

1. **Connect Wallet** → Choose username (Supabase)
2. **Create/Join Room** → Share room code

5. **Play!** → Winner takes all

### Game Flow:

```
Landing Page → Auth → Lobby → Game Room → Ready → Play → Results
```

### Socket Events:

All games use these Socket.io events:

- `game-started`: Game begins for all players
- `[game]-specific`: Each game has its own events
- `round-winner`: Winner determined

### Game-Specific Socket Events:

**Object Hunt:**
- `found-object`: Player found the target item
- `opponent-found-object`: Opponent's time received

**Hand Raise:**
- `hand-raised`: Player raised their hand
- `opponent-hand-raised`: Opponent's time received

**Rock Paper Scissors:**
- `rps-choice`: Player's gesture locked in
- `rps-opponent-choice`: Opponent's choice received

**Reflex Challenge:**
- `reflex-time`: Player's reaction time
- `reflex-opponent-time`: Opponent's time received

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Frontend:
