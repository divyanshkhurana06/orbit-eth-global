# üéÆ CURRENT GAME STATUS & ISSUES

## User Feedback:
- "0 games work like they do"
- "Table tennis looks like pong game"
- "I need real table tennis rackets etc"
- "Remove raise the hand game"

## What I'm Fixing:

### 1. ‚úÖ Hand Raise Game - REMOVED
- Deleted from game modes
- Deleted component file
- Removed from game rendering

### 2. üèì Table Tennis - NEEDS COMPLETE REDESIGN

**Current Issues:**
- Looks like basic pong (just rectangles)
- No visible racket/paddle in hand
- No table perspective
- No net visualization
- Too simple/basic

**What's Needed for "Real" Table Tennis:**
- **Visible racket in hand** (show actual paddle shape following hand)
- **3D perspective table** (with proper depth)
- **Net in the middle** (3D or visual representation)
- **Ball with spin/trajectory** (not just 2D)
- **Better graphics** (not just colored rectangles)

### 3. Other Games Status Check:

#### Rock Paper Scissors ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è
- Should work (just rewrote it)
- Hand skeleton visualization
- Best of 5 rounds
- **Test to confirm**

#### Object Hunt üîç
- TensorFlow COCO-SSD detection
- Should work
- **Test to confirm**

#### Tennis üéæ
- Has 3D physics already
- Gravity, bounce, perspective
- Might just need visual polish
- **Test to confirm**

## QUESTION FOR USER:

To make Table Tennis look professional and "hackathon winning", I have a few options:

### Option 1: Use Three.js (3D Graphics Library)
- Add Three.js for proper 3D rendering
- Create 3D table, racket, ball
- Realistic lighting and shadows
- **Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Result**: True 3D, very impressive

### Option 2: Enhanced 2D with Better Visuals
- Draw racket sprite/shape in hand position
- Isometric perspective for table
- Better shadows and effects
- Net visualization
- **Time**: 30-45 minutes
- **Result**: Much better looking, still 2D

### Option 3: User Provides 3D Model/Assets
- If you have 3D models for racket, table, etc.
- I can integrate them quickly
- **Time**: 20-30 minutes with assets
- **Result**: Professional with good assets

## RECOMMENDED: Option 1 (Three.js)
This would make it truly hackathon-winning quality with real 3D graphics.

Should I proceed with Three.js integration for Table Tennis?
