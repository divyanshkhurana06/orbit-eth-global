## 📝 Summary

**Before**: Fast but confusing - players jumped straight into games without seeing rules or confirming wagers.

**After**: Professional, clear, and consensual - players see rules, understand the wager, and explicitly agree before playing.

This creates a much better user experience and provides legal protection for real-money wagering! 💪
